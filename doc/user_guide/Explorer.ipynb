    "hvPlot API provides a simple and intuitive way to create plots. However when you are exploring data you don't always know in advance the best way to display it, or even what kind of plot would be best to visualize the data. You will very likely embark in an iterative process that implies choosing a kind of plot, setting various options, running some code, and repeat until you're satisfied with the output and the insights you get. The *Explorer* is a *Graphical User Interface* that allows you to easily generate customized plots, which in practice gives you the possibility to **explore** both your data and hvPlot's extensive API."
