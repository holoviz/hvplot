    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "hvPlot can display geographic data and can be used to add contextualisation layers:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Overlay the data over a tiled web map\n",
    "- Overlay the data over geographic/administrative features\n",
    "- Plot the data in a specific projection\n",
    "\n",
    "Many, but not all, of these features require [GeoViews](https://geoviews.org) to be installed, which is the geographic extension of HoloViews built on [Cartopy](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy) and [pyproj](https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj). You can install GeoViews with `pip install geoviews` or `conda install geoviews`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before plotting geographical data, you should know in which [coordinate system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_reference_system) the data is represented. This is important for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data may have to be [projected](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_projection) to another coordinate system, and to do so you may have to provide the original coordinate system.\n",
    "- Projecting data can be a computationally expensive operation and you should be aware of when this operation happens, to perhaps optimize it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two common coordinate systems you will encounter when dealing with geographic data and using hvPlot:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data represented by latitude/longitude (lat/lon) coordinates are often tied to the WGS84 geographic coordinate system ([EPSG:4326](https://epsg.io/4326)), that's how GPS data are located on the Earth. For example, the coordinates of Paris in this system are `(lat=48.856697, lon=2.351462)`.\n",
    "- Tiled web maps are displayed in the Web Mercator projection (also known as Pseudo-Mercator or Google Mercator, [EPSG:3857](https://epsg.io/3857)). Unlike WGS84 which expresses coordinates in lat/long decimal degrees, Web Mercator expresses them in easting (X) /northing (Y) metric units. For example, the coordinates of Paris in this system are `(easting=261763.552, northing=6250580.761)`."

Importantly, `tiles` is a parameter that can be used **without installing GeoViews if the data is already projected in Web Mercator**.\n",

    "The first is using the `rasterize` or `datashade` options to regrid the data before rendering it, i.e., rendering the data on the backend and then sending a more efficient image-based representation to the browser. One thing to note when using these operations is that it may be necessary to project the data **before** rasterizing it, e.g. to address wrapping issues. To do this provide `project=True`, which will project the data before it is rasterized (this also works for other types and even when not using these operations). Another reason why this is important when rasterizing the data is that if the CRS of the data does not match the displayed projection, all the data will be projected every time you zoom or pan, which can be very slow. Deciding whether to `project` is therefore a tradeoff between projecting the raw data ahead of time or accepting the overhead on dynamic zoom and pan actions."
