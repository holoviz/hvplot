    "# Large Timeseries Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Effectively representing temporal dynamics in large datasets requires selecting appropriate visualization techniques that ensure responsiveness while providing both a macroscopic view of overall trends and a microscopic view of fine details. This guide will explore various methods, such as **WebGL Rendering**, **LTTB Downsampling**, **Datashader Rasterizing**, and **Minimap Contextualizing**, each suited for different aspects of large timeseries data visualization. We predominantly demonstrate the use of hvPlot syntax, leveraging HoloViews for more complex requirements. Although hvPlot supports multiple backends, including Matplotlib and Plotly, our focus will be on Bokeh due to its advanced capabilities in handling large timeseries data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Rendering Bokeh plots in hvPlot or HoloViews has evolved significantly. Prior to 2023, Bokeh's custom HTML **Canvas** rendering was the default. This approach works well for datasets up to a few tens of thousands of points but struggles above 100K points, particularly in terms of zooming and panning speed. These days, if you want to utilize Bokeh's Canvas rendering, use `import holoviews as hv; hv.renderer(\"bokeh\").webgl = False` prior to creating your hvPlot or HoloViews object.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WebGL Rendering - Current Default\n",
    "\n",
    "Around mid-2023, the adoption of improved **WebGL** as the default for hvPlot and HoloViews allowed for smoother interactions with larger datasets by utilizing GPU-acceleration. It's important to note that WebGL performance can vary based on your machine's specifications. For example, some Apple Mac models may not exhibit a marked improvement in WebGL performance over Canvas due to GPU hardware configuration."

    "\n",
    "While WebGL and LTTB both send individual data points to the web browser, [Datashader](https://datashader.org) rasterizing offers a fundamentally different approach to visualizing large datasets. Datashader operates by generating a fixed-size 2D binned array tailored to your screen's resolution during each zoom or pan event. In this array, each bin aggregates data points from its corresponding location, effectively creating a 2D histogram. So, instead of transmitting the entire dataset, only this optimized array is sent to the web browser, thereby displaying all relevant data at the current zoom level and facilitating the visualization of the largest datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "❗ A couple important details: ❗\n",
    "1. As with LTTB downsampling, Datashader rasterization dynamically depends on Python and, therefore, won't update as you zoom in on our website. If you are locally running this notebook with a live Python process, the plot will automatically update with additional detail as you zoom in.\n",
    "2. Setting `line_width` to be greater than `0` activates [anti-aliasing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-aliasing), smoothing the visual representation of lines that might otherwise look too pixelated.\n",
