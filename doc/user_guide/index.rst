User Guide
**********

The user guide provides a detailed introduction to the API and
features of HoloPlot. In the `Introduction <Introduction.html>`_ you
will learn how to activate the plotting API and start using it. Next
you will learn how to use it to `display and save plots
<Display_and_Saving.html>`_ in the notebook, on the commandline, and
from a script.

Once the basics are covered you can learn how to use the plotting API
with `tabular data <Plotting_API.html>`_, `streaming data
<Streaming_Plots.html>`_ and `gridded data <XArray_Plotting.html>`_.

Lastly the `Statistical Plots <Statistical_Plots.html`_ section will
take you through a number of specialized plot types modelled on the
pandas.plotting module.
