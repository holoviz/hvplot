User Guide
**********

The user guide provides a detailed introduction to the API and
features of hvPlot. In the `Introduction <Introduction.html>`_ you
will learn how to activate the plotting API and start using it. Next
you will learn to use the API for tabular data and get an overview of
the `types of plots <Plotting.html>`_ you can generate and how to
`customize <Customization.html>`_ them; including how to customize
interactivity using `widgets <Widgets.html>`_. Next is an overview on how to
`display and save plots <Viewing.html>`_  in the notebook, on the
commandline, and from a script. Another section will introduce you to
generating `subplots <Subplots.html>`_ from your data.

Once the basics are covered you can learn how to use the plotting API
for specific types of data including `streaming data
<Streaming.html>`_, `gridded data <Gridded_Data.html>`_
`network graphs <NetworkX.html>`_, `geographic data <Geographic_Data.html>`_,
and `timeseries data <Timeseries_Data.html>`_. These sections are not meant
to be read in a particular order; you should take a look at any that seem
relevant to your data.

The `interactive <Interactive.html>`_ user guide introduces you to the
ability to use the APIs of your favorite data analysis libraries
interactively by allowing you to pass in widgets in place of constant
arguments. This will provide you with an invaluable tool to perform
exploratory analyses quickly but also build powerful and complex data
analysis pipelines using APIs you are already familiar with.

Lastly the `statistical plots <Statistical_Plots.html>`_ section will
take you through a number of specialized plot types modelled on the
pandas.plotting module and the `pandas API <Pandas_API.html>`_ section mimics
the `pandas visualization docs
<https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/visualization.html>`_
but using pandas.options.plotting.backend to do the plotting in HoloViews
rather than Matplotlib.
