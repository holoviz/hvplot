User Guide
**********

The user guide provides a detailed introduction to the API and
features of HoloPlot. In the `Introduction <Introduction.html>`_ you
will learn how to activate the plotting API and start using it. Next
you will learn to use the API for tabular data and get an overview of
the `types of plots <Plotting.html>`_ you can generate and how to
customize them. followed by an overview on how to use it to `display
and save plots <Display_and_Saving.html>`_ in the notebook, on the
commandline, and from a script. Another section will introduce you to
generating `subplots and grids <Subplots_and_Grids.html>`_ from your
data.

Once the basics are covered you can learn how to use the plotting API
for specific types of data including `streaming data
<Streaming_Plots.html>`_ and `gridded data <XArray_Plotting.html>`_.

Lastly the `Statistical Plots <Statistical_Plots.html>`_ section will
take you through a number of specialized plot types modelled on the
pandas.plotting module.

**Overview**:

* `Introduction <Introduction.html>`_
