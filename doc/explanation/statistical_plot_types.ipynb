    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Provides quantitative insights into correlations\n",
    "- Interactive linking allows exploration across all variable pairs\n",
    "- Familiar scatter plot format is easy to interpret\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** Identifying correlations, outliers, and clustering patterns between variable pairs\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:** Can become cluttered with many variables; doesn't show patterns across all dimensions simultaneously"

    "**Best for:** Visualizing overall differences between classes when you care more about separation than specific variable contributions\n",

    "\n",
    "**What it shows:** Frequency distribution of values in a single variable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Clear visualization of data distribution shape\n",
    "- Easy to identify skewness, modality, and outliers\n",
    "- Familiar and intuitive for most users\n",
    "- Customizable bin sizes for different levels of detail\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** Understanding the overall shape and spread of a single variable, identifying distribution patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:** Can be sensitive to bin size choices; doesn't show relationships between variables\n",
    "\n",
    "### Box Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it shows:** Five-number summary (minimum, Q1, median, Q3, maximum) plus outliers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Compact summary of distribution characteristics\n",
    "- Excellent for comparing distributions across groups\n",
    "- Clearly identifies outliers and quartile ranges\n",
    "- Robust to extreme values\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** Comparing distributions between groups, identifying outliers, understanding data spread and central tendency\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitations:** Hides detailed distribution shape; can miss bimodal or complex distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "### Violin Plots\n",
    "\n",
    "**What it shows:** Combination of box plot information with kernel density estimation\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strengths:**\n",
    "- Shows both summary statistics and distribution shape\n",
    "- Reveals multimodal distributions that box plots miss\n",
    "- Good for comparing complex distributions across groups\n",
    "- More informative than box plots for understanding distribution shape\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best for:** Comparing detailed distribution shapes across groups, when you need both summary statistics and distribution density\n",
