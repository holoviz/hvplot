Each of the sub-dataset has a random x, y-coordinate based on a normal distribution centered at a specific (x, y) location, with standard deviations derived from a power law, resulting in very dense to very scattered clusters. Each point also carries a `val` (`0` to `4`) and `cat` (`d1` to `d5`) column to identify its dataset and category.

    "\n",
    "The `aggregator` option determines how data is reduced when applying [`datashade=True`](option-datashade) or [`rasterize=True`](option-rasterize). Precisely, aggregators dynamically compute a single value per pixel when converting many raw data points into a rasterized image. By default, a simple `count` aggregator is applied, which creates a plot that displays how many data points are contained within each pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This can be particularly useful for large datasets where plotting every point is impractical. Choosing the right aggregator helps highlight the relevant aspects of the data â€” whether you want to count point density, show average values, or observe minimums and maximums across regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two main types of aggregators are available:\n",
    "- Mathematical combination of data such as the `count` of data points per pixel or the `mean` of a dimension of the supplied dataset, including: `'any'`, `'count'`, `'mode'`, `'mean'`, `'sum'`, `'var'`, `'std'`.\n",
    "- Selection of data from a dimension of the supplied dataset, or the index of the corresponding row in the dataset, including: `'first'`, `'last'`, `'min'`, `'max'`.\n",

    "`aggregator` accepts either:\n",
    "- A [Datashader reduction instance](https://datashader.org/api.html#reductions), such as `ds.count()` or `ds.mean('val')`.\n",
    "- A string (e.g. `'mean'`, `'count'`, `'min'`, `'max'`, etc.), in which case the aggregated dimension can be defined by setting the [`color`](option-color) option (if not, the first non-coordinate variable found is used).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `'count_cat'` or `'by'` aggregators can be used for categorical cata. `ds.by(<column>, <reduction>)` allows to define the per-category reduction function (default is `count`). Alternatively, setting the [`by`](option-by) option to a categorical column is equivalent to setting `aggregator=ds.by(<cat_column>)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two additional aggregators are available:\n",
    "- `ds.summary(...)` can be used to compute multiple aggregates simultaneously, by defining a sequence of key/value pairs representing the aggregate labels and reductions. For example, setting `aggregator=ds.summary(min_s=ds.min('s'), max_s=ds.max('s'))` will make both the `min_s` and `max_s` aggregated values available in the hover tooltip.\n",
    "- `ds.where(<selector_reduction>, lookup_column)` can be used to extract the values of another column based on a selector refuction (e.g. `'first'`, `'min'`). For example, setting `aggregator=ds.where(ds.min('s'), 'val')` will display in each pixel the value of the variable `'val'` where the variable `'s'` is minimum.\n",

Let's take for example a simple scatter plots set with `rasterize=True`; hovering over the image will only display the aggregated value per pixel (`'count'` by default), with no way to know more about each point (unless [`resample_when`](option-resample_when) is enabled and the user zooms in enough). Setting `selector` in this case would augment the tooltip with sample information from other variables, selected from *one unique row* of the dataset. Find out more about `selector` in HoloViews' [Interactive Hover for Big Data guide](https://dev.holoviews.org/user_guide/Interactive_Hover_for_Big_Data.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the [`aggregator`](option-aggregator) option, a `selector` refers to a [Datashader `Reduction` object](https://datashader.org/api.html#reductions). However, unlike `aggregator` that accepts reductions that can combine data in a pixel (e.g. `'mean'` or `'count'`), `selector` only accepts reductions that *select* values, including: `'first'`, `'last'`, `'min'`, and `'max'`. Valid options include:\n",
    "- A string object for reductions that do not require a variable name, including `'first'` and `'last'`.\n",
    "- A 2-tuple with a reduction name and a variable name, for reductions that require a variable name, including `'min'` and `'max'` (e.g. `('min', 'column')`).\n",
    "- A reduction instance, including `ds.first()`, `ds.last()`, `ds.min()`, and `ds.max()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "::: {note}\n",
    "The hover tooltip always requires a live kernel when `selector` is set as the values displayed need to be sent by the Python server. Without a live kernel, like on this webpage, all the values are displayed as `'undefined'`.\n",
    ":::\n",
    "\n",
    "When you hover over the first plot below, you will see a value for `s`, `val`, and `cat` in the bottom part of the tooltip. All these values originate from the same row in the DataFrame, that row being the first one found in the subdataset contained within this pixel. In the second plot, the values displayed are derived from the row where `val` is minimum within the hovered pixel."
