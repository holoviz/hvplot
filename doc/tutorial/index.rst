This tutorial will take you through all of the steps involved in
exploring data of many different types and sizes, building simple and
complex figures, working with billions of data points, adding
interactive behavior, widgets and controls, and deploying full
dashboards and applications.

Sections 00-13 of this tutorial have been given as a 1-day course led
by trained instructors.  For self-paced usage, you should expect this
material to take between 1 and 3 days if you do all of it.  Sections
0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 contain the most crucial and basic introductory
material, and should take a couple of hours of study.  All later sections
can be studied as needed or skipped if not relevant.

Section `00 Welcome <00_Welcome.html>`_  provides an overview of each of the
other sections involved, so please see that for more details or to get
started.
