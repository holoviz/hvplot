    "hvPlot API provides a simple and intuitive way to create plots. However when you are exploring data you don't always know in advance the best way to display it, or even what kind of plot would be best to visualize the data. You will very likely embark in an iterative process that implies choosing a kind of plot, setting various options, running some code, and repeat until you're satisfied with the output and the insights you get. The *Explorer* is a *Graphical User Interface* that allows you to easily generate customized plots, which in practice gives you the possibility to **explore** both your data and hvPlot's extensive API.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create an *Explorer* you pass your data to the high-level `hvplot.explorer` function which returns a [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org/) layout that can be displayed in a notebook or served in a web application. This object displays on the right-hand side a preview of the plot you are building, and on the left-hand side the various options that you can set to customize the plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that for the explorer to be displayed in a notebook you need to load the hvPlot extension, which happens automatically when you execute `import hvplot.pandas`. If instead of building Bokeh plots you would rather build Matplotlib or Plotly plot, simply execute once `hvplot.extension('matplotlib')` or `hvplot.extension('matplotlib')` before displaying the explorer."
