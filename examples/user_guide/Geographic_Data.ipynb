    "The plot API also has support for geographic data built on top of Cartopy and GeoViews. Both can be installed using conda with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c pyviz geoviews\n",

    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "To declare a geographic plot we have to supply a ``cartopy.crs.CRS`` (or coordinate reference system).  Coordinate reference systems are described in the [GeoViews documentation](http://geoviews.org/user_guide/Projections.html) and the full list of available CRSs is in the [cartopy documentation](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/v0.15/crs/projections.html). Only certain hvPlot types support geographic coordinates, currently including: 'points', 'polygons', 'paths', 'image', 'quadmesh', 'contour', and 'contourf'.\n",

    "If we want to overlay our data on geographic maps or reproject it into a geographic plot, we can set ``geo=True``, which declares that the data will be plotted in a geographic coordinate system.  The default coordinate system is the ``PlateCarree`` projection, i.e., raw longitudes and latitudes. If the data is in another coordinate system, you will need to declare an explicit ``crs`` as an argument, in which case `geo=True` is assumed.  Either way, once hvPlot knows that your data is in geo coordinates, it can be overlaid on top of ``geoviews.tile_sources`` and ``geoviews.features``:"

As you can see above, a QuadMesh will project each original bin or pixel into the correct non-rectangular shape determined by the projection, accurately showing the geographic extent covered by each sample. An Image, on the other hand, will always be rectangularly aligned in the 2D plane, which requires warping and resampling the data in a way that allows efficient display but loses accuracy at the pixel level. Unfortunately, rendering a large QuadMesh using Bokeh can be very slow, but there are two useful alternatives for datasets too large to be practical as native QuadMeshes.\n",
