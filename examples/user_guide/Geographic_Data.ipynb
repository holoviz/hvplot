    "The plot API also has support for geographic data built on top of Cartopy and GeoViews. Both can be installed using conda with:\n",
    "\n",
    "    conda install -c pyviz geoviews\n",

    "\n",
    "To declare a geographic plot we have to supply a ``cartopy.crs.CRS`` (or coordinate reference system).  Coordinate reference systems are described in the [GeoViews documentation](http://geoviews.org/user_guide/Projections.html) and the full list of available CRSs is in the [cartopy documentation](https://scitools.org.uk/cartopy/docs/v0.15/crs/projections.html). Only certain hvPlot types support geographic coordinates, currently including: 'points', 'polygons', 'paths', 'image', 'quadmesh', 'contour', and 'contourf'.\n",

If the data is in another coordinate system, you will need to declare an explicit ``crs`` as an argument, in which case `geo=True` is assumed.  Either way, once hvPlot knows that your data is in geo coordinates, it can be overlaid on top of ``geoviews.tile_sources`` and ``geoviews.features``:"

    "Note that when displaying raster data in a projection other than the one in which the data is stored, it is more accurate to render it as a ``quadmesh`` rather than an ``image``. As you can see above, a QuadMesh will project each original bin or pixel into the correct non-rectangular shape determined by the projection, accurately showing the geographic extent covered by each sample. An Image, on the other hand, will always be rectangularly aligned in the 2D plane, which requires warping and resampling the data in a way that allows efficient display but loses accuracy at the pixel level. Unfortunately, rendering a large QuadMesh using Bokeh can be very slow, but there are two useful alternatives for datasets too large to be practical as native QuadMeshes.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is using the ``datashade`` or ``rasterize`` options to regrid the data before rendering it, i.e., rendering the data on the backend and then sending a more efficient image-based representation to the browser. One thing to note when using these operations is that it may be necessary to project the data **before** rasterizing it, e.g. to address wrapping issues. To do this provide ``project=True``, which will project the data before it is rasterized (this also works for other types and even when not using these operations). Another reason why this is important when rasterizing the data is that if the the CRS of the data does not match the displayed projection, all the data will be projected every time you zoom or pan, which can be very slow. Deciding whether to ``project`` is therefore a tradeoff between projecting the raw data ahead of time or accepting the overhead on dynamic zoom and pan actions."
